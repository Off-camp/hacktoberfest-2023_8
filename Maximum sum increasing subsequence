Given an array of n positive integers. Find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order i.e. a strictly increasing subsequence. 

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 5, arr[] = {1, 101, 2, 3, 100} 
Output: 
106
Explanation:
The maximum sum of a increasing sequence is obtained from {1, 2, 3, 100},




def maxSumIncreasingSubsequence(arr, n):
    maxSum = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        maxSum[i] = arr[i]

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and maxSum[i] < maxSum[j] + arr[i]:
                maxSum[i] = maxSum[j] + arr[i]

    return max(maxSum)

# Example usage
N = 5
arr = [1, 101, 2, 3, 100]

result = maxSumIncreasingSubsequence(arr, N)
print(result)  # Output: 106
